NOTE: these tests are simply to show the performance advantages by utilizing
individual character lexing.

Benchmark demostration with new Lexer technique after three consecutive tests.\
At peak, `Lexer v2` performed `3.49x` faster than the original Lexer.\
Over 5 tests, the average performance of `Lexer v2` was `3.38x` faster.

Improvements that could be made:

- removing the one regex could potentially push performance quite a bit higher.
